Some examples of what you might want to know:

How many flags did we successfully submit?
> db.submitstats.find({team:6, msg:"Congratulations, you scored a point!"}).count()
8752

How often did we submit our own flags?
> db.submitstats.find({team:6, msg:"This is your own flag."}).count()
684

How often was our service broken?
> db.runstats.find({team:6,retval:2,service:"ezpz"}).count()
218

How often did the orga screw up the checkscripts?
> db.runstats.find({retval:3,service:"erno"}).count()
0
> db.runstats.find({retval:3,service:"ezpz"}).count()
10
> db.runstats.find({retval:3,service:"rost"}).count()
1100

Which service was easy and which service was hyper-secure?
> db.captures.group({key: { service: 1 }, initial: { caps: 0 }, reduce: function(a,b) { b.caps += 1 }})
	{
		"service" : "ezpz",
		"caps" : 75401
	},
	{

	},
	{

	{

		"caps" : 46
	},
	{

Who exploited us the most?
> db.captures.group({key: { team: 1 }, initial: { caps: 0 }, reduce: function(a,b) { if(a.owner == 42) { b.caps += 1 } }})
