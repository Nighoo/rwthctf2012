Game Manual:

1. Antifrustration Tips:

Use "help" for general command ideas.
use "help more" for ALL commands that will get interpreted.


There are not that many locations. You should think about making a little map.

The game is ironic of you think try think of ALL meanings of a command.



2. Flags:

Flags can be hidden in the old library the following way:

	* find a book
	* write on a page of that book (e.g. > write-on page 15 my little secret)
	  the page is then added to your iventory (i.e. this is the 1st page in your inventory)
	* hide the page (e.g. > hide page 1)
	( *You can also hide multiple page (i.e. hide pages 1 to 2) )

Flags can be found by finding a special page

	* i.e. > search 15 will return "my little secret"
